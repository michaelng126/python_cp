# python_cp - Competitive Programming Library for Python

__TLDR:__ Competitive programming library for Python, in development.

I've recently started learning CP - competitive programming. It's great for:
1. improving implementation speed __'from mind to code'__
2. getting __familiar with libraries__ in your chosen language
3. learning clever __algorithms__
4. developing __competitive resilience__, 
5. and of course, __enjoying__ the spirit of competition!

I decided to use Python, especially for point 2 above. But almost all resources online are for C++.

As you improve, it's essential to understand and be able to implement classic algorithms. It's just as important to have a 'library' with those already implemented, so that these become second nature to rattle through.

So here, I've shared my own library, and will continue to expand and improve it as I progress. It is far from complete, nor can I guarantee that it is bug-free. I hope that by sharing this, it will be of help to anyone in the community trying to improve.

Furthermore - any comments/corrections are most welcome!

Finally, my sincere thanks to my friend who has provided much help (and encouragement) along the way, to another also, and to the Codeforces and Atcoder platforms for their fantastic teams and contribution to the community.

All the best,
Michael
